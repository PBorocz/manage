* Manage
  Inspired by [[https://github.com/tfeldmann/organize/blob/main/manage.py][Thomas Feldman's manage.py]] script in his Organize project, my /manage/ package automates many common operations for poetry & org-based package management. In particular, those that I don't do regularly and/or require multiple steps to perform.
** Approach
   - The exact steps necessary to achieve a ~target~ are specified in a local "manage.yaml" file that is specific to your project.
   - Plugins will be possible by adding operations to the ~manage/commands~ directory (they'll be picked up automatically).
** Assumptions
*** Tools
    - [[https://python-poetry.org][Poetry]] is used manage our package dependencies *and* build environment.
    - We assume that execution of this script is from the TOP level of a project, i.e. at the same level as pyproject.toml.
    - The version string in pyproject.toml is the SINGLE and CANONICAL version string in our project/package.
*** Versioning
    - We use semantic versioning with ~poetry version~ to update/manage our version number.
*** Readme Management
    - We manage our README in an Org format (see [[https://orgmode.org/][Emacs Org Mode]] for details)
    - We assume README.org is kept in the top-level directory.
    - We use a section in README.org to keep an release history, with an ~*** Unreleased
*** v0.0.7 - 2023-01-25~ header for upcoming items for the next release.
*** Configuration
    - We need *two* --group dev packages over and above our default environment to support this script tomli and requests.
    - We assume the following entries are available in our environment (either set in shell or through .env):
     |--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
     | GITHUB_USER                    | Github user id                            | JohnJacobJingleheimerSchmidt                                             |
